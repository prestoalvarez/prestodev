## Getting Started
Today, developers can write programs, including complex, large programs like a ZK Tendermint light client or type-1 zkEVM using Reth, in Rust (with std support), generate proofs and verify them. Most Rust crates should be supported and can be used seamlessly by your program. Example programs can be found in the examples folder.
